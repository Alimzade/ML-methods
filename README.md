# Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch

This repository contains implementations of popular machine learning algorithms built from scratch using numeric libraries. The goal of these implementations is to achieve high accuracy while providing a deep understanding of the internal workings of each algorithm.

## Overview

Each machine learning model has been meticulously coded to ensure clarity and efficiency. The implementations are found under the `/methods` directory, with corresponding tests located in the `/tests` directory to validate the correctness and performance of each algorithm.

## Models Implemented

The following is a list of machine learning algorithms implemented in this repository:

- Clustering
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Ensemble Methods (Various versions)
- Linear Models
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Naive Bayes
- Single Layer Perceptron (SLP)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Trees

## Getting Started

To get started with these implementations, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone Alimzade/ml-models
```


### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- Python 3.x
- Relevant numeric libraries (e.g., NumPy, SciPy)

You can install the necessary libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy
```
